This app is based solely on the "File System" theory in "Operating System" domain.

From "Modern Operating System" by Andrew Tanenbaum, page 265

Skip to Directory operation. There are create (create a directory), delete (delete a directory), opendir(open directory), closedir(close directory), readdir(return the next entry in an open directory), rename(rename directory), link(Skip), unlink(a directory entry is removed)

So I need to have create, delete, opendir,closedir,rename, 5 actions, 5 directory operation
